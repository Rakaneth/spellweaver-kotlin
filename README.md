# HOW TO PLAY #

## Spellcasting ##

As an apprentice _Spellweaver_, you have learned to weave four of the seven elements: 
_Fire, Ice, Lightning,_ and _Earth._ The secrets of the other three elements, _Force, Light, and Darkness,_ 
will be found in mystical spellbooks left in the dungeon, filled with your master's notes.

Up to three elements can be combined in a single spell. Each element must be different.
The first element chosen determines the **base element** of the spell. Every spell combination
involving _Fire, Ice, Lightning,_ or _Earth_ as a base element inflicts damage on the enemy in some way.
Some enemies are **weak** against certain elements and **resistant** to others.

The table below displays the known effects (and costs in Power in parentheses) of the four basic elements.
The effects of the other three elements are left as exercises for the enterprising Spellweaver. 
Weaving _Force, Light,_ and _Darkness_ can change your spell in surprising ways!

| Cast | Fire              | Ice              | Lightning         | Earth                         | 
| ---- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1    | Fire dmg (1)      | Ice dmg (1)      | Lightning dmg (1) | _Poison_ enemy (1)            |
| 2    | _Burn_ enemy (1)  | _Slow_ enemy (2) | _Haste_ self (3)  | _Elemental Armor_ self (1)    |
| 3    | AOE burst (2)     | AOE cloud (2)    | AOE line (1)      | _Elemental Weapon_ self (1)   |

Be mindful of your Power. Spellweaving takes a heavy toll on the user, especially when they stretch
limits! While it is possible to weave spells with little or no Power, it is dangerous to do so, as any
resultant costs are taken directly from the Spellweaver's life force! Your master has warned that he has
witnessed the deaths of three former apprentices who did not heed their limits.

The easiest way to recover Power is to rest and meditate; the mind is much quicker to recover from this
kind of exertion than the body is.

## Foes ##

While descending into the depths to retrieve your master's spellbook, you may encounter various types 
of monsters. These monsters may vary in exact species, but the following symbols indicate types:

* `d`: demon
* `e`: elemental
* `f`: fungus
* `i`: insect
* `r`: rodent
* `D`: greater demon
* `E`: greater elemental

## Growing Stronger ##

Your master warned you that your task would be dangerous, but he also said you would learn from it.
Indeed, as you descend into the depths, you will naturally grow stronger in the following ways:

* Attacking an enemy in melee trains `Atk`.
* Dealing damage to an enemy in melee trains `Dmg`.
* Being attacked in melee trains `Dfp`.
* Taking damage from enemies trains `HP` and `Tou`.
* Suffering effects from enemies trains `HP` and `Tou`.
* Casting spells trains `Will` and `Pwr`.
